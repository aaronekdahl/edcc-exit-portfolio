      <h1>A Look Back At The Past</h1>
        <h3>Reflections on Fall 2018's CIS241 Web Development Class</h3>
            <p>Looking back at the last quarter, it has really been eye opening. There is so much more to the world of web development than throwing some text on the screen and "hitting" publish.</p>

            <p>After reading through the CIW site and workign through the examples it contained you really get a good feel for what it would take to learn and fluently code in HTML. Also of note, it is interesting to see how a reliable site such as CIW can look like it has stood still (in a good way) during the past couple of years. The design of the site itself isn't fancy, it's not loaded with weird graphics, images or javascript/css animations that make usability a factor.</p>

            <p>Overall, I am really pleased with the course and now it turned out. This course really laid out a solid foundation in relation to HTML and the basic concepts of web development. The only thing I found missing was a better tie-in with CSS. Although, CSS does come later in the program, it would make sense to get a better feel for it while working with HTML.</p>

      <h1>What I Am Looking Forward To</h1>
          <p>I am really looking forward to the next couple of quarters. From learning how to style sites with CSS to adding scripts through javascript. It will be great to finally get a good feel for the total package required to either work front-end or back-end web application development projects.</p>
