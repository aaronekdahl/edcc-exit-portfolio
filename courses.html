                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>This course is currently one of my favorite courses. It is a continuation of the Systems Analysis class which I didn't enjoy near as much. I really love getting in the mix and actually creating user interfaces and system design mockups, I see this being an important part of any upcoming career opportunites.

                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>Web development I was great. I got a refresher on the basics of HTML and CSS. This really helped prepare me for what was to come over the next few quarters.

                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>Web development II was difficult. Although it was one of the tougher courses in the whole program, I really enjoyed working with and creating files that functioned with javascript.
                    <ul>

                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>Web development IV was fun. It was cool learning about Joomla! as a content managmement system instead of the usual that is Wordpress. I wish more people were on board with Joomla! so that the plugins and templates and widgets could be on par or surpass those in Wordpress. I also learned the importance of SEO and how to impart and enhance any site that I create with it.

                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>Web development V was one of my all time favorite courses. I have always been partial to CSS.

                  </p>

                  <h3>ART 225 - Introduction to Graphic Design</h3>
                  <p><strong>Course Description: </strong>Introduction to graphic design and Adobe InDesign for creating effective layouts for print and web.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>I have always been good at are related things (web design included), so it was cool to have a break from all the coding/programming aspects of my degree. I got the gist of inDesign and put together what I thought was a pretty cool portfolio for my final project.

                  <p><strong>Course Description: </strong>Advance graphic design that incorporates the production process for the research and development of an individual project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>ART 226 was a bit more challenging than ART 225. A lot of time had to go in to the development and planning of what would be an ad campaign against distracted drivers. I did however enjoy this course as well and had a great time over the summer creating my "emoji" ad-campaign.

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>During this course I had a realization that I might just enjoy SQL and database design more than actual web development. I learned what it takes to make a viable database for large scale use in a business or personal environment.
                    <ul>
                      <li><span><a href="documentation/syllabus/cis250-syllabus.pdf">CIS 250 Syllabus</a></span></li>

                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h3>CIS 251 - Structured Query Language (SQL)</h3>

                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>In this course I really got in to the depths of database creation and querying. Being able to create and query databases with a few simple lines of code felt so empowering. Again, this goes hand in hand with CIS 250 and I couldn't have enjoyed it anymore than I did.

                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Course Experience: </strong>In this course I learned a lot about something I had no prior knowledge of. Development stacks and customer relationship managers. I had plenty of use with CMS' over the years but I never dug in to what it would take to make them "commercial." Learning how to setup online stores and CRMs to manage customers and inventory was really great.
